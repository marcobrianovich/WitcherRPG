=== Lizbetta of Eyselaan

Born in 1240

* *1251*
My happiest memories are also my earliest. I was a cheerful youngling, unruly and hellbent from the call of the grandad's cockells till the fall of the star-filled vail. Father practically egged-on my bad behavior. He was the chief bodyguard of Count Viston Lauretton-de-Truane, a demanding job that often felt like a gaol sentence. I think seeing me living a life of complete freedom sated his own hunger for a carefree life.
